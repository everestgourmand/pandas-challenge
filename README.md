This project analyzes data from PyCity Schools to gain insights into the academic performance of various schools in the district. Using a dataset that includes information about schools, students, and their academic performance in math and reading, we conducted several analyses to compare the performance of charter and district schools across key metrics. The analysis includes school performance summaries, comparisons by school size, type, and spending, as well as trends in student passing rates.
